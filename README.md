# Reverse Engineering Binary Files Using GDB
`This was my Project 1 for the CS69.17 Software Security class at Dartmouth College.`

In this project, I acquire hands-on experience in practical reverse engineering, developing a comprehensive understanding of ELF binary programs, their execution, and their interaction with the underlying software system.

Given several ELF binary files, which require a user to enter a password, I crack their passwords by performing reverse engineering on each binary.

Please refer to the write-up pdf for more details on the project and my takeaways.
